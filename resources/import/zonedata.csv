R4-1,Low Density Residential,http://www.nyc.gov/html/dcp/html/zone/zh_r4-1.shtml,"R4-1 contextual districts, like R3-1 districts, permit only one- and two family detached and semi-detached houses. Despite a narrower minimum lot width of 25 feet for detached homes, houses in R4-1 districts tend to be larger than those in R3-1 districts because of the higher floor area ratio(FAR) of 0.75 plus an attic allowance. The perimeter wall may rise to 25 feet, compared to 21 feet in R3-1 districts, before sloping or being set back to a maximum building height of 35 feet. Sections of Middle Village in Queens and Bay Ridge in Brooklyn are R4_1 districts.",,
R4A,Low Density Residential,http://www.nyc.gov/html/dcp/html/zone/zh_r4a.shtml,"R4A contextual districts are similar to R3A and R3X districts in that only one- and two-family detached residences are permitted. Differences in the maximum permitted floor area ratio(FAR) and minimum required lot size, however, result in variations in the typical building envelope found in each district. Characterized by houses with two stories and an attic beneath a pitched roof, R4A districts have an FAR of up to 0.75 (plus an attic allowance) and a minimum lot width of 30 feet. The districts are usually mapped in older neighborhoods, such as Woodlawn and Throgs Neck in the Bronx.",,
R4B,Low Density Residential,http://www.nyc.gov/html/dcp/html/zone/zh_r4b.shtml,"Primarily a contextual rowhouse district limited to low-rise, one- and two-family attached residences, R4B districts also permit detached and semi-detached buildings. However, the floor area ratio(FAR) of 0.9 and maximum building height of 24 feet typically produce a two-story, flat-roofed rowhouse. Parts of Bay Ridge in Brooklyn and Middle Village and Brookville in Queens are mapped R4B.",,
R5,Low Density Residential,http://www.nyc.gov/html/dcp/html/zone/zh_r5.shtml,"R5 districts allow a variety of housing at a higher density than permitted in R3-2 and R4 districts. The floor area ratio(FAR)of 1.25 typically produces three-and four-story attached houses and small apartment houses. With a height limit of 40 feet, R5 districts provide a transition between lower- and higher-density neighborhoods and are widely mapped in Brooklyn, Queens and the Bronx. Portions of Windsor Terrace and Ocean Parkway in Brooklyn are R5 districts.",,
R5A,Low Density Residential,http://www.nyc.gov/html/dcp/html/zone/zh_r5a.shtml,"R5A contextual districts, mapped in the northeast Bronx neighborhoods of Olinville and Williamsbridge, permit only one- and two-family detached residences with a maximum 1.1floor area ratio(FAR). Similar to R4A districts, R5A districts are characterized by houses with two stories and an attic beneath a pitched roof, but the greater FAR and higher perimeter wall allow for somewhat larger buildings.",,
R5B,Low Density Residential,http://www.nyc.gov/html/dcp/html/zone/zh_r5b.shtml,"Although an R5B contextual district permits detached and semi-detached buildings, it is primarily a three-story rowhouse district typical of such neighborhoods as Windsor Terrace and Bay Ridge in Brooklyn. The traditional quality of R5B districts is reflected in the district's height and setback, front yard and curb cuts regulations that maintain the character of the neighborhood.",,
R5D,Low Density Residential,http://www.nyc.gov/html/dcp/html/zone/zh_r5d.shtml,"R5D contextual districts, designed to encourage residential growth along major corridors in auto-dependent areas of the city, are mapped in portions of the Jamaica and Rockaway Park neighborhoods in Queens and on Williamsbridge Road in the northeast area of the Bronx.",,
R6,Moderate to High Density Residential,http://www.nyc.gov/html/dcp/html/zone/zh_r6.shtml,"R6 zoning districts are widely mapped in built-up, medium-density areas in Brooklyn, Queens and the Bronx. The character of R6 districts can range from neighborhoods with a diverse mix of building types and heights to large-scale 'tower in the park' developments such as Ravenswood in Queens and Home crest in Brooklyn.",,
R6A,Moderate to High Density Residential,http://www.nyc.gov/html/dcp/html/zone/zh_r6a.shtml,"R6A is a contextual district where the Quality Housing bulk regulations are mandatory. These regulations produce high lot coverage, six- or seven-story apartment buildings set at or near the street line. Designed to be compatible with older buildings found in medium-density neighborhoods, R6A districts are mapped in the Bronx, Brooklyn and Queens.",,
R6B,Moderate to High Density Residential,http://www.nyc.gov/html/dcp/html/zone/zh_r6b.shtml,"R6B districts are often traditional row- house districts, which preserve the scale and harmonious streetscape of neighborhoods of four-story attached buildings developed during the 19th century. Many of these houses are set back from the street with stoops and small front yards that are typical of Brooklyn's 'brownstone' neighborhoods, such as Park Slope, Boerum Hill and Bedford Stuyvesant.",,
R7-1,Moderate to High Density Residential,http://www.nyc.gov/html/dcp/html/zone/zh_r7.shtml,"R7 districts are medium-density apartment house districts mapped in much of the Bronx as well as the Upper West Side in Manhattan and Brighton Beach in Brooklyn. The height factor regulations for R7 districts encourage lower apartment buildings on smaller zoning lots and, on larger lots, taller buildings with less lot coverage. As an alternative, developers may choose the optional Quality Housing regulations to build lower buildings with greater lot coverage.",,

R7B,Moderate to High Density Residential,http://www.nyc.gov/html/dcp/html/zone/zh_r7b.shtml,"In contextual R7B districts, the mandatory Quality Housing regulations are similar to those of R6B districts but the higher floor area ratio(FAR) and height limit generally produce six- to seven-story apartment buildings rather than the rowhouses typical of R6B districts.

R7X,Moderate to High Density Residential,http://www.nyc.gov/html/dcp/html/zone/zh_r7x.shtml,"R7X districts are also governed by contextual Quality Housing bulk regulations but the substantially higher floor area ratio(FAR) and maximum building height typically produce taller, bulkier buildings than in R7A and R7B districts. The flexibility of the R7X regulations is exemplified by the nine- to 13-story apartment buildings in the R7X districts mapped along major thoroughfares in Harlem in Manhattan and Jackson Avenue in Long Island City in Queens.",,
R8,Moderate to High Density Residential,http://www.nyc.gov/html/dcp/html/zone/zh_r8.shtml,"Apartment buildings in R8 districts can range from mid-rise, eight- to ten-story buildings to much taller buildings set back from the street on large zoning lots. This high density residential district is mapped along the Grand Concourse in the Bronx and on the edge of Brooklyn Heights. R8 districts are also widely mapped in Manhattan neighborhoods, such as Washington Heights. New buildings in R8 districts may be developed under either height factor regulations or the optional Quality Housing regulations that often reflect the older, pre-1961 neighborhood streetscape.",,
R8A,Moderate to High Density Residential,http://www.nyc.gov/html/dcp/html/zone/zh_r8a.shtml,"The contextual Quality Housing bulk regulations, which are mandatory in R8A districts, typically result in high lot coverage10- to 12-story apartment buildings, set at or near the street line.

Parts of DUMBO in Brooklyn and West Chelsea in Manhattan are R8A districts.",,
R8B,Moderate to High Density Residential,http://www.nyc.gov/html/dcp/html/zone/zh_r8b.shtml,"R8B contextual districts usually present the same unified blocks of 'brownstone' rowhouses as R5B and R6B districts but the higher floor area ratio(FAR) of 4.0 creates a taller building that is commonly found on the narrow side streets of the Upper West Side and the Upper East Side in Manhattan. The mandatory Quality Housing bulk regulations encourage new six-story apartment buildings, with a setback at the top story, that fit in well with the rows of 19th century houses.",,
R8X,Moderate to High Density Residential,http://www.nyc.gov/html/dcp/html/zone/zh_r8x.shtml,"R8X contextual districts are governed by Quality Housing bulk regulations.

R9,Moderate to High Density Residential,http://www.nyc.gov/html/dcp/html/zone/zh_r9.shtml,"In R9 districts, which are mapped along several major thoroughfares in Manhattan, such as West 96th Street, new buildings can be developed underheight factor regulations or the optional Quality Housing regulations as in R6 through R8 districts. The optional Quality Housing regulations in R9 districts are the same as the R9A regulations. Designed in part for institutional purposes (mainly hospitals), most R9 height factor buildings are developed pursuant to the tower rules, which are applicable only in the city's higher-density areas, and commercial districts with an R9residential district equivalent(C1_8, C2-7 and C6-3)..",,
