          <strong>What is zoning?</strong>
          Zoning is the set of rules that a city comes up with to define acceptable land use in specific areas. 
        </p>
        <p>
          It consists of
          <a href='http://www.nyc.gov/html/dcp/html/zone/zonetext.shtml'>regulations</a>
          that control how big of a building you can build on a property,
          what you can do inside it. You can't just build anything anywhere -
          every property in New York City lives in a zoning district of one kind or another.
          
        </p>
        <p>
          There are 3 <strong>Basic Zoning Districts</strong> in New York City. They are:

        <p>The three basic districts are further divided into a range of low, medium, and high-density districts. </p>
