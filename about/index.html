    <p>Gotham Zoning is an interactive map that lets you:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        find out
        <strong>how your building is zoned</strong>
      </li>
      <li>
        learn
        <strong>where to locate your business</strong>
      </li>
      <li>
        explore
        <strong>zoning patterns</strong>
        throughout the city
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      To make New York City's zoning code digestible by humans,
      we took inspiration from one of our favorite games:
      <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SimCity_2000">Sim City 2000</a>.
      It started with the color scheme:
      <strong style='color: #7DD67D;'>green</strong>
      for residential,
      <strong style='color: #7474D7;'>blue</strong>
      for commercial and
      <strong style='color: #DCDC7F;'>yellow</strong>
      for industrial. (This oversimplifies things a bit,
      <a href='/about#zoning-categories'>read the full story</a>.)
      From there we got a little carried away. Graphics, sounds, music, oh my.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gotham Zoning is a fork of <a href = 'http://secondcityzoning.org/'>2nd City Zoning</a>, and is entirely
      <a href='#code'>open source</a>
      and built with

    <h4 id='what-is-zoning'>What is zoning?</h4>
    <p>
      Zoning basically makes sure a factory doesn't open next to a school.
    </p>
    <p>
      It consists of
      <a href='/resources/Chicago-Zoning-Ordinance.pdf'>regulations</a>
      that control how big of a building you can build on a property,
      what you can do inside it. You can't just build anything anywhere -
      every property in Chicago lives in a zoning district of one kind or another.
    </p>
    <p>
      These districts shape the physical character and economic
      makeup of our neighborhoods. They're the DNA of our city's build environment:
      some districts allow high rises to sprout around downtown, others encourage
      walkable, mixed-use commercial corridors on arterial streets, and
      still others insulate the city's lingering industrial corridors.
    </p>
    <p>
      Zoning is controlled by Chicago's
      <a href='http://www.cityofchicago.org/city/en/about/council.html'>City Council</a>.
      They have a
      <a href='https://www.cityofchicago.org/city/en/depts/dcd/supp_info/zoning_board_of_appeals.html'>Zoning Board</a>
      that reviews all proposed zoning changes, which are then passed on to a City Council vote. Unlike most cities, each zoning change, when approved, is put down in the books as a
      <strong>separate ordinance</strong>.

      We are using some music and sound effects from
      <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SimCity_2000'>Sim City 2000</a>
      on this website. This is not to make a Sim City competitor, but to make the experience of diving in to zoning laws fun!

      We love that the City of Chicago has opened their data for citizens to use. This site represents just one example of what can be done with it. We hope it inspires others to dive in to zoning (and other) datasets the
